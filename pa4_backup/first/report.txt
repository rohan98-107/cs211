I used an array of pointers to "head" nodes which are the first all first 
elements of linked lists. Each "node" was a struct I called Line, each line 
contained a valid bit, tag, next pointer and read counter (for LRU). 

The prefetcher reduced the number of misses in most cases because IN GENERAL 
the assumption that was made that the next available address would be requested 
was a good assumption. However, if the program did NOT take into account spatial 
locality then the prefetching would have been disastrous for the program's runtime.
